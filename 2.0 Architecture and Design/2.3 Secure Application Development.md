# 2.3 Summarize secure application development, deployment, and automation concepts

### **Environment:**

- **Development:**

  - _Development environment_ is where software applications are created and initial testing occurs.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Software developers use development environments to write, test, and debug code before releasing it for further testing.

- **Test:**

  - _Test environment_ is dedicated to testing software under controlled conditions.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Quality assurance teams use the test environment to conduct various tests, such as unit testing and integration testing, before deploying to production.

- **Staging:**

  - _Staging environment_ replicates the production environment for final testing before deployment.

    **Real-life Scenario:** IT teams use a staging environment to validate that applications work seamlessly with the production-like settings before releasing them to the live environment.

- **Production:**

  - _Production environment_ is the live system where end-users access and use the software.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Once an application has successfully passed testing, it is deployed to the production environment for use by customers or employees.

- **Quality Assurance (QA):**

  - _Quality Assurance environment_ is where rigorous testing and quality control measures are applied to ensure the software meets predefined standards.

    **Real-life Scenario:** QA engineers use this environment to identify and fix bugs or issues before the application is released to production.

### **Provisioning and Deprovisioning:**

- _Provisioning_ involves setting up and configuring resources, while _deprovisioning_ involves removing or decommissioning resources.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An automated provisioning process ensures that new servers are configured with the required software and security settings, and deprovisioning removes unused resources to optimize costs.

### **Integrity Measurement:**

- _Integrity measurement_ ensures that software and data remain unchanged and secure from unauthorized modifications.

  **Real-life Scenario:** A system uses checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of critical files, ensuring they have not been tampered with.

### **Secure Coding Techniques:**

- **Normalization:**

  - _Normalization_ is a database design technique to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Developers use normalization to structure databases efficiently, reducing the risk of data anomalies.

- **Stored Procedures:**

  - _Stored procedures_ are precompiled sets of one or more SQL statements stored for reuse.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Developers use stored procedures to enhance database security by controlling access to data through defined procedures.

- **Obfuscation/Camouflage:**

  - _Code obfuscation_ involves intentionally making code more challenging to understand to deter reverse engineering.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Security-conscious developers use code obfuscation to protect intellectual property in mobile applications.

- **Code Reuse/Dead Code:**

  - _Code reuse_ promotes the use of existing code, while _dead code_ refers to unused portions of code.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Developers follow secure coding practices by reusing well-tested code libraries and removing dead code to minimize potential vulnerabilities.

- **Server-side vs. Client-side Execution and Validation:**

  - _Server-side execution and validation_ ensure critical operations occur on the server side, minimizing the risk of client-side manipulation.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Input validation and business logic are enforced on the server side to prevent malicious input or manipulation by clients.

- **Memory Management:**

  - _Memory management_ practices prevent memory-related vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Developers use secure memory allocation and deallocation techniques to prevent exploitation by attackers.

- **Use of Third-Party Libraries and Software Development Kits (SDKs):**

  - The _use of third-party libraries and SDKs_ requires careful consideration of security implications and regular updates.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Developers ensure that third-party libraries and SDKs are regularly patched to address security vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of exploitation.

- **Data Exposure:**

  - _Data exposure_ prevention involves safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Developers implement encryption and access controls to protect sensitive data from exposure during transmission or storage.

### **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP):**

- _OWASP_ provides resources and tools to improve the security of software.

  **Real-life Scenario:** Development teams refer to OWASP guidelines and tools to identify and address common security issues, such as injection attacks and cross-site scripting.

### **Software Diversity:**

- **Compiler:**

  - _Compiler diversity_ involves using different compilers to build software, reducing the risk of a single vulnerability affecting all software.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Developers compile software with multiple compilers to enhance resilience against specific compiler-related vulnerabilities.

- **Binary:**

  - _Binary diversity_ involves generating multiple versions of the same software with different binary compositions.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization creates diverse binaries of critical software to minimize the impact of a single binary-related vulnerability.

### **Automation/Scripting:**

- **Automated Courses of Action:**

  - _Automated courses of action_ involve implementing automated responses to specific events or triggers.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization uses automated courses of action to respond to security incidents, such as blocking malicious IP addresses or isolating compromised systems.

- **Continuous Monitoring:**

  - _Continuous monitoring_ involves real-time monitoring of systems for security events and anomalies.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Security teams implement continuous monitoring to detect and respond to unauthorized activities promptly.

- **Continuous Validation:**

  - _Continuous validation_ ensures that security controls are consistently effective over time.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Continuous validation mechanisms regularly assess the effectiveness of security controls, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

- **Continuous Integration:**

  - _Continuous integration_ involves automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository to detect issues early in the development process.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Developers use continuous integration tools to identify and fix security-related issues in the codebase during the development phase.

- **Continuous Delivery:**

  - _Continuous delivery_ automates the process of deploying tested code changes to production.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Organizations adopt continuous delivery practices to ensure that secure, tested code is rapidly and consistently deployed to production environments.

- **Continuous Deployment:**

  - _Continuous deployment_ automates the release of code changes to production without manual intervention.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Companies embracing DevSecOps practices use continuous deployment to deliver secure software updates automatically.

### **Elasticity:**

- _Elasticity_ refers to the ability to scale computing resources dynamically based on demand.

  **Real-life Scenario:** Cloud-based applications leverage elasticity to handle increased user traffic during peak periods and scale down during low-demand periods.

### **Scalability:**

- _Scalability_ is the ability of a system to handle growing amounts of work.

  **Real-life Scenario:** A web application designed for scalability can efficiently accommodate an increasing number of users without a significant impact on performance.

### **Version Control:**

- _Version control_ manages changes to source code over time, enabling collaboration and tracking.

  **Real-life Scenario:** Development teams use version control systems like Git to track changes, collaborate on code, and roll back to previous versions in case of issues.

This comprehensive list covers various aspects of development environments, provisioning and deprovisioning, integrity measurement, secure coding techniques, Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), software diversity, automation/scripting, elasticity, scalability, and version control. Each term is accompanied by real-life scenarios to illustrate its practical application in the field of software development and security.
