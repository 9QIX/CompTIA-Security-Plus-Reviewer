# 1.8 Explain the techniques used in penetration testing

### **Penetration Testing:**

- **Known Environment:**

  - _Penetration testing in a known environment_ involves assessing the security of a system or network with detailed knowledge of its infrastructure.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A company hires penetration testers to assess the security of its internal network, providing detailed information about the existing infrastructure.

- **Unknown Environment:**

  - _Penetration testing in an unknown environment_ simulates an attack on a system or network without prior knowledge of its infrastructure.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A penetration testing team is tasked with assessing the security of a new cloud-based application without prior information about its architecture.

- **Partially Known Environment:**

  - _Penetration testing in a partially known environment_ involves testing a system or network with limited information about its infrastructure.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A company provides penetration testers with some information about its network but intentionally withholds certain details to simulate a real-world scenario.

- **Rules of Engagement:**

  - _Rules of engagement_ define the scope, limitations, and rules for a penetration test.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Before conducting a penetration test, a company and the penetration testing team agree on specific rules, such as the duration of the test, systems to be tested, and acceptable testing methods.

- **Lateral Movement:**

  - _Lateral movement_ involves the progression through a network or system after gaining initial access.

    **Real-life Scenario:** After exploiting a vulnerability in a web server, a penetration tester moves laterally to compromise additional servers within the network.

- **Privilege Escalation:**

  - _Privilege escalation_ involves gaining higher levels of access or permissions within a system.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A penetration tester exploits a vulnerability to elevate their privileges, gaining administrative access to a critical server.

- **Persistence:**

  - _Persistence_ involves maintaining access to a system or network over an extended period.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A penetration tester successfully deploys a backdoor that allows them to retain access even after the initial penetration test concludes.

- **Cleanup:**

  - _Cleanup_ involves restoring systems to their original state after completing a penetration test.

    **Real-life Scenario:** After identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, a penetration testing team ensures that all changes made during the test are reverted to avoid any impact on the production environment.

- **Bug Bounty:**

  - _Bug bounty programs_ involve offering rewards to individuals who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A company launches a bug bounty program, encouraging ethical hackers to discover and report security vulnerabilities in its software or systems.

- **Pivoting:**

  - _Pivoting_ involves using compromised systems as a platform to attack other systems within the network.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A penetration tester, having gained access to a lower-privileged server, uses it as a pivot point to target higher-value assets in the network.

### **Passive and Active Reconnaissance:**

- **Drones:**

  - _Drones_ can be used for aerial reconnaissance to gather information about physical locations.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization deploys drones to survey its facilities and identify potential vulnerabilities, such as unsecured access points.

- **War Flying:**

  - _War flying_ involves searching for and mapping wireless networks while in motion, often using a vehicle.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A penetration tester drives through a city scanning for open Wi-Fi networks and assessing their security.

- **War Driving:**

  - _War driving_ involves actively searching for Wi-Fi networks using a vehicle.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization conducts a war driving exercise to identify weakly secured wireless networks within its corporate campus.

- **Footprinting:**

  - _Footprinting_ is the process of collecting information about a target, such as IP addresses, domain names, and network infrastructure.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker uses publicly available information to gather details about a company's network architecture, employees, and technology stack.

- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):**

  - _OSINT_ involves gathering information from publicly available sources to gain insights into potential vulnerabilities.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A penetration tester uses OSINT techniques to gather information about an organization's employees, partners, and technology infrastructure from sources like social media and public records.

### **Exercise Types:**

- **Red-Team:**

  - _Red-team exercises_ involve simulating real-world cyber attacks to test an organization's defenses.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A company hires a red team to launch simulated cyber attacks, testing its security posture and incident response capabilities.

- **Blue-Team:**

  - _Blue-team exercises_ focus on testing an organization's internal security team's ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization conducts a blue-team exercise to evaluate its security operations center's response to a simulated cyber attack.

- **White-Team:**

  - _White-team exercises_ involve neutral parties that oversee and evaluate the effectiveness of red and blue teams.

    **Real-life Scenario:** In a cybersecurity competition, a white team assesses the performance of red and blue teams, ensuring fair play and accurate evaluation.

- **Purple-Team:**

  - _Purple-team exercises_ combine elements of both red and blue teams, fostering collaboration between offensive and defensive security teams.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization conducts a purple-team exercise to enhance cooperation between penetration testers and internal security teams, ensuring a holistic approach to security testing.
