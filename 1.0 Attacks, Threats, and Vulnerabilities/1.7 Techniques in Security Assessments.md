# 1.7 Summarize the techniques used in security assessments

### **Threat Hunting:**

- **Intelligence Fusion:**

  - _Intelligence fusion_ involves combining different types of threat intelligence to gain a comprehensive understanding of potential risks.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization integrates open-source intelligence (OSINT), proprietary threat feeds, and internal incident data to identify patterns and enhance threat hunting capabilities.

- **Threat Feeds:**

  - _Threat feeds_ provide real-time data on emerging threats and indicators of compromise (IoCs).

    **Real-life Scenario:** A threat hunter subscribes to threat feeds to receive timely information about new malware variants that may target the organization.

- **Advisories and Bulletins:**

  - _Advisories and bulletins_ are official communications that provide guidance on security threats.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A threat hunter monitors security advisories from government agencies to stay informed about potential nation-state cyber threats.

- **Maneuver:**

  - _Maneuver_ refers to taking actions to respond to or mitigate identified threats.

    **Real-life Scenario:** After identifying a potential threat during threat hunting, security teams take proactive measures to isolate affected systems and prevent further damage.

### **Vulnerability Scans:**

- **False Positives:**

  - _False positives_ occur when a vulnerability scanner incorrectly identifies a non-existent vulnerability.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A vulnerability scanner flags a service as vulnerable to a specific attack, but further investigation reveals that the service is not affected.

- **False Negatives:**

  - _False negatives_ occur when a vulnerability scanner fails to detect an actual vulnerability.

    **Real-life Scenario:** The vulnerability scanner misses a critical security flaw during a scan, leaving the system exposed to potential exploitation.

- **Log Reviews:**

  - _Log reviews_ involve analyzing system logs to identify abnormal or suspicious activities.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Security analysts review logs to detect unauthorized access or unusual patterns that may indicate a security incident.

- **Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed:**

  - _Credentialed scans_ use authenticated access to gather more comprehensive information about the system.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A credentialed scan provides detailed information about software versions and configurations, helping identify vulnerabilities that may not be visible in non-credentialed scans.

  - _Non-credentialed scans_ lack authenticated access and may provide limited information.

    **Real-life Scenario:** In scenarios where credentials are not available, non-credentialed scans are still valuable for identifying externally visible vulnerabilities.

- **Intrusive vs. Non-Intrusive:**

  - _Intrusive scans_ actively test and exploit vulnerabilities to determine their impact.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization conducts an intrusive scan to simulate a real-world attack and assess the effectiveness of security controls.

  - _Non-intrusive scans_ focus on identifying vulnerabilities without actively exploiting them.

    **Real-life Scenario:** In environments with strict policies, non-intrusive scans are performed to minimize the risk of disrupting operations.

- **Application:**

  - _Application scans_ focus on identifying vulnerabilities in software applications.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization scans its web applications for vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, to ensure secure coding practices.

- **Web Application:**

  - _Web application scans_ specifically target vulnerabilities in web applications.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A company regularly scans its e-commerce website for potential vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation by attackers seeking to steal customer information.

- **Network:**

  - _Network scans_ identify vulnerabilities in network infrastructure, devices, and services.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An IT team conducts regular network scans to identify and patch vulnerabilities in routers, switches, and other network devices.

- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):**

  - _CVE_ is a standardized identifier for known vulnerabilities.

  - _CVSS_ provides a scoring system to assess the severity of vulnerabilities.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Security teams use CVE identifiers and CVSS scores to prioritize and address high-risk vulnerabilities efficiently.

- **Configuration Review:**

  - _Configuration reviews_ assess system configurations to identify potential security weaknesses.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization reviews the configuration settings of its servers to ensure compliance with security best practices.

### **Syslog/Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**

- **Review Reports:**

  - _Reviewing reports_ generated by SIEM systems helps identify security incidents and trends.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Security analysts examine SIEM reports to detect patterns of unusual login activities that may indicate a potential breach.

- **Packet Capture:**

  - _Packet capture_ involves capturing and analyzing network traffic.

    **Real-life Scenario:** During an investigation, security analysts use packet capture to analyze communication patterns and identify malicious activities.

- **Data Inputs:**

  - _Data inputs_ refer to the information sources integrated into a SIEM for analysis.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A SIEM collects data inputs from firewalls, antivirus solutions, and intrusion detection systems to provide a comprehensive view of the security landscape.

- **User Behavior Analysis:**

  - _User behavior analysis_ assesses normal patterns of user activity to identify anomalies.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization uses user behavior analysis to detect suspicious activities, such as an employee accessing sensitive data outside of regular working hours.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**

  - _Sentiment analysis_ involves analyzing text data to assess attitudes or emotions.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A company uses sentiment analysis in its SIEM to monitor social media for mentions of the organization that may indicate a potential reputational risk.

- **Security Monitoring:**

  - _Security monitoring_ involves continuously observing systems for signs of security incidents.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Security teams monitor SIEM dashboards for alerts related to unauthorized access, malware infections, or other security events.

- **Log Aggregation:**

  - _Log aggregation_ combines log data from various sources for centralized analysis.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization aggregates logs from different servers and devices into a central repository for streamlined monitoring and analysis.

- **Log Collectors:**

  - _Log collectors_ are components that gather and forward log data to a centralized repository.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Log collectors installed on network devices forward logs to a central SIEM server for analysis and correlation.

### **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR):**

- _SOAR_ combines orchestration, automation, and response to improve the efficiency of security operations.

  **Real-life Scenario:** In response to a detected incident, a SOAR platform automatically triggers predefined actions, such as isolating an affected system, notifying relevant teams, and initiating a vulnerability scan.
