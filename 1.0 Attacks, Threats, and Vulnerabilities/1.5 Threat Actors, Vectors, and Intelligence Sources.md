  - _Insider threats_ involve individuals within an organization who misuse their access to cause harm.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An employee with access to sensitive data intentionally leaks confidential information for personal gain.

- **State Actors:**

  - _State actors_ are government entities engaged in cyber operations for various purposes, including intelligence gathering and espionage.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A government-backed cyber unit conducts a cyber-espionage campaign targeting foreign governments to gather intelligence.

- **Hacktivists:**

  - _Hacktivists_ are individuals or groups who use hacking techniques to promote a social or political agenda.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A hacktivist group launches cyber attacks against a corporation to protest its environmental practices.

- **Script Kiddies:**

  - _Script Kiddies_ are individuals with limited technical skills who use pre-written scripts or tools to launch cyber attacks.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A script kiddie launches a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using readily available tools to disrupt a gaming server.

- **Criminal Syndicates:**

  - _Criminal syndicates_ are organized groups involved in cybercrime activities for financial gain.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A criminal syndicate engages in ransomware attacks, encrypting the data of businesses and demanding payment for its release.

- **Hackers:**

  - _Hackers_ encompass a diverse group with varying motivations and skills.

    - **Authorized:**

      - _Authorized hackers_ are individuals employed to test and enhance the security of systems with the consent of the owner.

        **Real-life Scenario:** A company hires ethical hackers to conduct penetration testing to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in its network.

    - **Unauthorized:**

      - _Unauthorized hackers_ conduct cyber attacks without legal permission or authorization.

        **Real-life Scenario:** An unauthorized hacker exploits a software vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to a company's database.

    - **Semi-Authorized:**

      - _Semi-authorized hackers_ may have some form of permission but engage in activities beyond the agreed scope.

        **Real-life Scenario:** An employee with limited authorization gains access to sensitive data and leaks it without proper authorization.

- **Shadow IT:**

  - _Shadow IT_ refers to technology and software used within an organization without the explicit approval or knowledge of the IT department.

    **Real-life Scenario:** Employees use unapproved cloud services to share files, exposing the organization to security risks.

- **Competitors:**

  - _Competitors_ may engage in cyber espionage to gain a competitive advantage.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A company hires a hacker to infiltrate a competitor's systems and steal information about upcoming product releases.

### **Attributes of Actors:**

- **Internal/External:**

  - _Internal actors_ are individuals within an organization, while _external actors_ originate from outside.

- **Level of Sophistication/Capability:**

  - _Level of sophistication_ refers to the skill and expertise of an actor in carrying out cyber attacks.

- **Resources/Funding:**

  - _Resources and funding_ indicate the financial support available to actors for planning and executing cyber attacks.

- **Intent/Motivation:**
  - _Intent and motivation_ represent the goals and reasons behind an actor's involvement in cyber activities.

### **Vectors:**

- **Direct Access:**

  - _Direct access_ involves physical or remote access to systems for unauthorized activities.

- **Wireless:**

  - _Wireless_ vectors target vulnerabilities in wireless networks.

- **Email:**

  - _Email_ vectors exploit vulnerabilities in email systems, often through phishing or malware attachments.

- **Supply Chain:**

  - _Supply chain_ vectors exploit weaknesses in the supply chain to compromise the final product.

- **Social Media:**

  - _Social media_ vectors involve exploiting social media platforms for malicious activities, such as spreading misinformation or phishing.

- **Removable Media:**

  - _Removable media_ vectors involve using external devices to introduce malware or extract data.

- **Cloud:**
  - _Cloud_ vectors target vulnerabilities in cloud services and infrastructure.

### **Threat Intelligence Sources:**

- **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT):**

  - _OSINT_ involves gathering intelligence from publicly available sources.

- **Closed/Proprietary:**

  - _Closed/proprietary_ sources include non-publicly available information held by specific organizations.

- **Vulnerability Databases:**

  - _Vulnerability databases_ provide information about known vulnerabilities and their patches.

- **Public/Private Information-Sharing Centers:**

  - _Information-sharing centers_ facilitate the exchange of threat intelligence between public and private entities.

- **Dark Web:**

  - The _dark web_ is a part of the internet that requires specific tools for access and is often associated with illegal activities.

- **Indicators of Compromise:**

  - _Indicators of compromise_ (IoCs) are observable events or evidence of a security incident.

- **Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS):**

  - _Automated Indicator Sharing_ involves automated sharing of threat intelligence.

- **Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)/Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII):**

  - _STIX/TAXII_ are standards for representing and exchanging threat intelligence.

- **Predictive Analysis:**

  - _Predictive analysis_ involves forecasting future cyber threats based on historical data and trends.

- **Threat Maps:**

  - _Threat maps_ visually represent real-time or historical cyber threats on a geographical or network map.

- **File/Code Repositories:**
  - _File/code repositories_ may contain information about vulnerabilities and exploits.
