### **Password Attacks:**

- _Password attacks_ involve attempts to gain unauthorized access by exploiting password vulnerabilities.

  - **Spraying:**

    - _Spraying_ involves using common passwords across multiple accounts to increase the chances of success.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker uses a list of commonly used passwords to attempt unauthorized access to multiple user accounts.

  - **Dictionary:**

    - _Dictionary attacks_ involve using a pre-built list of common words as potential passwords.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker systematically tries every word in the dictionary as a password to gain unauthorized access.

  - **Brute Force:**

    - _Brute force attacks_ involve systematically trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found.

    - **Offline:**

      - In _offline brute force_, attackers have access to hashed password files.

        **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker steals a password database and attempts to crack hashed passwords offline.

    - **Online:**

      - In _online brute force_, attackers attempt to log in directly to a system, trying various combinations.

        **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker uses automated tools to attempt thousands of password combinations on a login page.

  - **Rainbow Table:**

    - _Rainbow table attacks_ use precomputed tables of hash values to quickly crack hashed passwords.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker uses a rainbow table to find the original password from a hashed value.

  - **Plaintext/Unencrypted:**

    - _Plaintext attacks_ involve obtaining and using passwords in their raw, unencrypted form.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker intercepts login credentials transmitted over an unsecured network.

### **Physical Attacks:**

- _Physical attacks_ involve gaining unauthorized access through physical means.

  - **Malicious Universal Serial Bus (USB) Cable:**
