# 1.3 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks

### **Privilege Escalation:**

- _Privilege escalation_ is the process by which an attacker gains higher-level access or permissions than originally intended.

  **Real-life Scenario:** A user exploits a software vulnerability to elevate their privileges from a standard user to an administrator, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive systems.

### **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

- _Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)_ is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into a website's input fields, causing those scripts to execute when other users view the affected pages, potentially stealing their session cookies.

### **Injections:**

- _Injections_ involve injecting malicious code into a system or application.

  - **Structured Query Language (SQL):**

    - _SQL injection_ involves injecting SQL code into database queries to manipulate or retrieve data.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker injects SQL code into a login form, bypassing authentication and gaining unauthorized access to a database.

  - **Dynamic-Link Library (DLL):**

    - _DLL injection_ involves injecting malicious dynamic-link library code into a running process.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker injects a DLL into a running application to execute unauthorized code, potentially compromising the integrity of the system.

  - **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP):**

    - _LDAP injection_ involves manipulating LDAP queries to gain unauthorized access to directory services.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker manipulates an LDAP query to retrieve sensitive information, such as user credentials, from a directory service.

  - **Extensible Markup Language (XML):**

    - _XML injection_ involves injecting malicious XML content into an application.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker injects malicious XML data into a web application, exploiting vulnerabilities and potentially gaining unauthorized access.

### **Pointer/Object Dereference:**

- _Pointer/Object Dereference_ occurs when a program tries to access a memory location that has been freed or is invalid.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a program, causing it to dereference a pointer that points to an unintended or malicious location, leading to unexpected behavior.

### **Directory Traversal:**

- _Directory Traversal_ (or Path Traversal) is an attack that allows an attacker to access files or directories outside the webroot.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker manipulates input parameters to access sensitive files or directories on a web server, potentially exposing confidential information.

### **Buffer Overflows:**

- _Buffer overflows_ occur when a program writes more data to a block of memory, or buffer, than it was allocated for, potentially leading to code execution.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker sends excessive data to a program's input, overflowing the buffer and injecting malicious code that could compromise the system.

### **Race Conditions:**

- _Race conditions_ occur when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events.

  - **Time of Check/Time of Use:**

    - _Time-of-check/time-of-use race conditions_ involve changes in a system between the time a check is performed and the time the result is used.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker exploits a race condition to manipulate files between the time they are checked for access permissions and the time they are actually used by a program.

### **Error Handling:**

- _Error handling_ refers to the methods employed by a program to manage errors during its execution.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker intentionally triggers an error condition in a web application to obtain detailed error messages, which may reveal sensitive information about the system.

### **Improper Input Handling:**

- _Improper input handling_ occurs when a program does not adequately validate or sanitize user inputs.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker submits specially crafted input to a web form, exploiting improper input handling to inject malicious code or manipulate the application's behavior.

### **Replay Attack:**

- _Replay attacks_ involve the unauthorized reuse of valid data.

  - **Session Replays:**

    - _Session replays_ occur when an attacker intercepts and replays network traffic to impersonate a legitimate user.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker captures a user's session token and replays it to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.

### **Integer Overflow:**

- _Integer overflow_ occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the allotted space.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker manipulates integer variables in a program to overflow, potentially leading to unintended behavior or system crashes.

### **Request Forgeries:**

- _Request forgeries_ involve manipulating or forging requests to deceive a web application.

  - **Server-Side:**

    - _Server-side request forgery_ occurs when an attacker tricks a server into making requests to internal resources.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker forges a request that tricks a server into making requests to internal databases, potentially retrieving sensitive information.

  - **Cross-Site:**

    - _Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)_ occurs when an attacker tricks a user's browser into making requests on their behalf without their knowledge.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker creates a

malicious website that, when visited by a logged-in user, submits unauthorized requests on behalf of the user to a target website.

### **Application Programming Interface (API) Attacks:**

- _API attacks_ involve exploiting vulnerabilities in application programming interfaces.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker manipulates API requests to a financial application, gaining access to sensitive financial data or conducting unauthorized transactions.

### **Resource Exhaustion:**

- _Resource exhaustion_ attacks involve consuming resources to degrade the performance of a system or cause it to become unresponsive.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker floods a web server with a large number of requests, causing it to become overwhelmed and potentially denying service to legitimate users.

### **Memory Leak:**

- A _memory leak_ occurs when a program allocates memory but fails to release it properly, leading to a gradual depletion of available memory.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker exploits a memory leak in a server application, causing it to consume an increasing amount of memory over time, potentially resulting in system instability.

### **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Stripping:**

- _SSL stripping_ is an attack that downgrades secure HTTPS connections to insecure HTTP connections, allowing an attacker to intercept and modify communication.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker intercepts HTTPS traffic and downgrades it to HTTP, enabling them to capture sensitive information exchanged between a user and a website.

### **Driver Manipulation:**

- _Driver manipulation_ involves altering or replacing system drivers to compromise the functionality or security of a system.

  - **Shimming:**

    - _Shimming_ involves inserting a shim—a layer of code—between a driver and the operating system.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker inserts a shim into a graphics driver, intercepting and modifying communication between the operating system and the graphics hardware.

  - **Refactoring:**

    - _Refactoring_ involves modifying the code of a driver without changing its external behavior, making it susceptible to exploitation.

      **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker refactors a USB driver to introduce vulnerabilities, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the system.

### **Pass the Hash:**

- _Pass the hash_ is an attack where an attacker captures password hash values and uses them to authenticate without knowing the original passwords.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker intercepts and captures hashed passwords, then uses these hashes to gain unauthorized access to systems without knowing the actual passwords.
