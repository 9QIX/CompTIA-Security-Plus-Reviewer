# 1.4 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with network attacks

### **Wireless:**

- **Evil Twin:**

  - _Evil Twin_ is a rogue Wi-Fi access point that appears to be a legitimate one to trick users into connecting.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker sets up an Evil Twin Wi-Fi network with a similar name to a popular public network, luring users to connect and potentially intercepting their data.

- **Rogue Access Point:**

  - A _Rogue Access Point_ is an unauthorized wireless access point added to a network.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An employee sets up a personal Wi-Fi router at work without authorization, potentially exposing the corporate network to security risks.

- **Bluesnarfing:**

  - _Bluesnarfing_ is the unauthorized access of information from a wireless device through Bluetooth connections.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker exploits Bluetooth vulnerabilities to access and steal contacts, messages, or files from a victim's mobile device.

- **Bluejacking:**

  - _Bluejacking_ is the act of sending unsolicited messages or files to Bluetooth-enabled devices.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An individual sends a text message or image to nearby Bluetooth devices, often for harmless pranks or mischief.

- **Disassociation:**

  - _Disassociation_ is a wireless attack that disconnects a device from a Wi-Fi network.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker uses disassociation frames to force users off a Wi-Fi network, disrupting their connectivity.

- **Jamming:**

  - _Jamming_ involves disrupting wireless communications by transmitting interference on the same frequency.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker uses a signal jammer to interfere with Wi-Fi signals in a specific area, disrupting wireless connections.

- **Radio Frequency Identification (RFID):**

  - _RFID_ uses radio waves to identify and track objects or individuals.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An organization uses RFID tags to track inventory, enabling efficient monitoring of stock levels and movement.

- **Near-Field Communication (NFC):**

  - _NFC_ is a short-range communication technology used for contactless data transfer.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A user makes a payment by tapping their NFC-enabled smartphone on a payment terminal.

- **Initialization Vector (IV):**

  - _Initialization Vector (IV)_ is a random value used in wireless encryption to ensure secure communication.

    **Real-life Scenario:** In Wi-Fi security, a strong IV is crucial to the encryption process, preventing attackers from predicting patterns in encrypted data.

### **On-Path Attack:**

- _On-path attack_ (previously known as man-in-the-middle attack/man-in-the-browser attack) occurs when an attacker intercepts or alters communication between two parties.

  **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker intercepts communications between a user and a website, capturing login credentials or injecting malicious content into the communication.

### **Layer 2 Attacks:**

- **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Poisoning:**

  - _ARP poisoning_ involves manipulating ARP messages to associate a legitimate IP address with a different MAC address.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker sends fake ARP messages, associating their MAC address with the IP address of a gateway, intercepting traffic intended for the gateway.

- **Media Access Control (MAC) Flooding:**

  - _MAC flooding_ involves overwhelming a switch's MAC address table to cause it to enter a state where it behaves like a hub, forwarding traffic to all ports.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker floods a switch with a large number of fake MAC addresses, causing it to operate inefficiently and potentially facilitating unauthorized access.

- **MAC Cloning:**

  - _MAC cloning_ involves changing a device's MAC address to match the MAC address of an authorized device.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker clones the MAC address of an authorized device to gain access to a secured network.

### **Domain Name System (DNS):**

- **Domain Hijacking:**

  - _Domain hijacking_ occurs when an attacker gains control over a domain by unauthorized access to domain registrar accounts.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker gains access to a domain registrar account, changes the domain's registration information, and takes control of the domain.

- **DNS Poisoning:**

  - _DNS poisoning_ involves corrupting the DNS cache to redirect domain name resolutions to malicious IP addresses.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker injects false DNS information into a cache, causing users to be redirected to a malicious website when attempting to access a legitimate one.

- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Redirection:**

  - _URL redirection_ occurs when an attacker redirects a user from a legitimate website to a malicious one.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker manipulates a website's URL redirection feature to direct users to a phishing site instead of the intended destination.

- **Domain Reputation:**

  - _Domain reputation_ refers to the overall trustworthiness of a domain based on historical behavior.

    **Real-life Scenario:** A security system blocks access to a website with a poor domain reputation, as it has been associated with phishing or malware distribution.

### **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS):**

- **Network:**

  - _Network DDoS_ floods a network with traffic, causing a service disruption.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker overwhelms a website's servers with a massive volume of traffic, rendering the site inaccessible to legitimate users.

- **Application:**

  - _Application DDoS_ targets specific applications or services to disrupt their functionality.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker floods a web application with requests, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.

- **Operational Technology (OT):**

  - _OT DDoS_ targets industrial control systems or critical infrastructure, disrupting essential services.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker launches a DDoS attack on a power grid's control systems, causing a temporary disruption in electricity distribution.

### **Malicious Code or Script Execution:**

- **PowerShell:**

  - _PowerShell_ is a task automation framework used for scripting and shell-based tasks.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker uses PowerShell scripts to execute malicious commands on a victim's system, potentially compromising security.

- **Python:**

  - _Python_ is a programming language that can be used for both legitimate and malicious scripting.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker utilizes Python scripts to automate malicious activities, such as data exfiltration or system compromise.

- **Bash:**

  - _Bash_ (Bourne Again SHell) is a Unix shell and scripting language.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker leverages Bash scripts to execute commands on a targeted system, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities.

- **Macros:**

  - _Macros_ are automated sequences of actions in software applications, often used for malicious purposes in documents.

    **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker embeds malicious macros in a Microsoft Word document, exploiting them when the document is opened to execute code.

- **Visual Basic for Applications (VBA):**
  - _VBA_ is a programming language used for automation in Microsoft Office applications. **Real-life Scenario:** An attacker creates malicious VBA macros in an Excel spreadsheet, enabling the execution of harmful code when the document is opened.
